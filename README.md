Umbra-Portal
============

The Official Corporate, Legal & Governance Gateway of Umbra-Noesis
------------------------------------------------------------------

Umbra-Portal is the central access point for all official documentation within the Umbra-Noesis ecosystem.  
It serves as the unified hub for:

- Corporate structure & company information  
- Legal documentation  
- Licensing frameworks  
- Branding standards  
- Vendor & partner onboarding  
- Official system notices and governance policies  

This portal exists as the public-facing “front desk” of the Umbra-Noesis organization.

Purpose
-------

Umbra-Portal provides a stable, permanent home for materials that define how Umbra-Noesis operates as a company and as a technology ecosystem.

It ensures that partners, developers, clients, and regulatory bodies can reliably access:

- Terms of use  
- Licensing tiers & technology rights  
- Trademark usage policy  
- Whitepapers & system overviews  
- Privacy and compliance statements  
- Official release notes

- EVAA Cognition Engine  
- PCe — Personal Cognitive Environment
